     *  handling the quirks in extracting certain kinds of info.
     *

     *  (\c vstart and \c vend, and \c pstart and \c pend) are equivalent to \c
     *  std::begin and \c std::end respectively, aside from any quirks in the
     *  physical address listings. In other words, if I felt like coming up with
     *  the iterators, we could transform pstart and a potentially corrected
     *  pend into iterators into the ROM.
